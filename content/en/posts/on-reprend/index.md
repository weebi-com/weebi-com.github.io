June 26, 2019. Dakar, Senegal.
Binta is inputting the vegetables she sells on her Weebi tablet. The application has helped her manage her stock and sales.

After a two-year hiatus, Sidy is thrilled to announce that the service is back! The application has been revamped with a new version (the 3rd) available on:

- Android Weebi Playstore
- iOS Weebi Appstore
- macOS link on weebi.com
- Windows link on weebi.com

The application remains available for free, and we only ask for your email upon initialization to be able to assist you if needed.

Weebi also offers a tailored solution with a new pro kit at 199,000 CFA comprising:

- The tablet (iPad mini 2)
- The protective stand (designed and manufactured in Dakar)
- The portable Bluetooth thermal printer for receipts

Training is optional at 9,900 CFA, particularly for preparing the product catalog and stock entries.

For any questions, clarifications, or orders in millions, feel free to contact Sidy via phone, WhatsApp, or email:
